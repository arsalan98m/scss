Learning SCSS -> CSS with superpowers
*) They make writing styles easier more flexible and more reuseable

*) Now it does this by bringing typical programming constructs like 
functions, loops, Varaibles and inheritance into css and it makes css 
so much flexible and powerful in the way we write rules
for example: we could loop through a list of colors and generate a background 
color class and a font color class for each of them 

*) It also add other features to css like rule nesting invisible comments parent selectors and a lot of other stuff which make it much easier to write more complex css selectors

*) In general browsers don't understand sass it would understand only plain css if we add extra sass features to the browser we need a compiler and we need to compile a scss file into css file then we can hook that css file up to our html page now there's several option when it comes to compiling sass into css a really easy option if we are using vs code is live sass compiler extension however the way that we'll be doing it by using a task runner called gulp now it's a little more work to setup than using the live sass compiler package but it offers more compilation options it also allows us to use the sass debug tool to do this we need some few packages using npm.

Covered:
Varaibles
Nesting
partials -> meaning separate our css styles
mixins -> if we can use something repeatedly we can create mixin - this like a function
