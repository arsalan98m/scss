Learning SCSS -> CSS with superpowers
*) They make writing styles easier more flexible and more reuseable

*) Now it does this by bringing typical programming constructs like 
functions, loops, Varaibles and inheritance into css and it makes css 
so much flexible and powerful in the way we write rules
